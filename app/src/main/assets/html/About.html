        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>LightPuzzle is an engaging puzzle game designed to challenge your logic and problem-solving skills. In this game, you’ll encounter a grid of lights that can either be ON or OFF. The objective is to turn off all the lights on the board by following specific rules and interactions. Each move affects the lights in unpredictable ways, making each game session unique and challenging.</p>

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>Here’s a quick guide to help you get started with LightPuzzle:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>At the start of the game, you’ll see a grid with some lights turned on and some off.</li>
            <li>Click on any light in the grid. This action will toggle the light you clicked and the adjacent lights (up, down, left, right) between ON and OFF.</li>
            <li>The goal is to turn off all the lights by carefully choosing which lights to toggle.</li>
            <li>If you manage to turn off all lights, you win! Otherwise, you can reset the game and try again for a better strategy.</li>
            <li>Keep track of your score, which counts your moves. The fewer moves you use, the higher your score!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Good luck, and enjoy the challenge!</p>
